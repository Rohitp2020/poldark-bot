Q: require vs import
A: * Both are used to load libraries/modules in Node.js, but:
    - require → Old system (CommonJS).
        eg: const express = require("express");
    - import → New system (ES Modules, aka ESM).
        eg: import express from "express";
    
   * Most of the new APIs has been written based on 'import' style so be careful

Q: Plan for adding speech input (your voice) and response (Gemini’s answer):
A: Step 1: Capture Your Voice in Browser
            - We’ll use the Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition) to record your speech.
            - It will convert your voice into text.
   Step 2: Send Text to Gemini API
            - Once your speech is converted into text, we’ll send that text to your backend (/api/gemini).
            - Backend will forward it to Gemini and get the AI’s response.
   Step 3: Speak the Response
            - We’ll use the SpeechSynthesis API (built into browsers) to convert Gemini’s response back into speech.
            - So you’ll hear the bot talk back to you.
   
   You Speak → Browser converts to text → Send to Gemini → Gemini replies → Browser speaks back
