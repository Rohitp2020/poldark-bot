Poldark Bot is a chatbot built with Node.js and Express that can interact with users and provide smart responses. Itâ€™s lightweight, fast, and easy to extend with APIs for more functionality.
It is built on top of Google Gemini API.

Tech Stack:
Backend: NodeJs and ExpressJS
Frontend: Html/css/js
API: Google gemini API

Drawbacks: Currently it is not remembering the previous chats, and not giving much interactive answers. In my next upgrade i go to target this drawback.
